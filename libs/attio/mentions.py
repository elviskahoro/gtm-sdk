    """Idempotent upsert against the ``social_mention`` custom object.

    Uses Attio's assert endpoint with ``matching_attribute=mention_url``.
    The endpoint creates the record if no match exists, or updates the
    single match in place. ``mention_url`` is declared ``is_unique`` in
    the object schema, so multi-match is impossible by construction.

    The same value payload is used for create and update — see
    `build_mention_values` for why source identity fields are always sent.

    No-downgrade rule: a CSV backfill (``src/octolens/backfill.py``) carries no
    relevance opinion and stamps ``relevance_score="unknown"``; live Octolens
    deliveries always send low/medium/high. So ``"unknown"`` means "do not write
    relevance" — we drop ``relevance_score``/``relevance_comment`` from the
    assert entirely. Attio leaves omitted attributes untouched, so an existing
    live-scored value is preserved and a new record is left unscored. Omitting
    the field (rather than reading the current value and conditionally writing)
    is race-free: it can never overwrite a ``relevance_score`` a live webhook
    writes concurrently.
