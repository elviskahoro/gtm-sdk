"""Pydantic model tests for libs/fathom/models.py.

The redacted fixture at ``api/samples/fathom.recording.redacted.json`` has
zero ``action_items``, so the ``Assignee`` shape was never exercised by
the existing parse tests. Real Fathom recording webhooks routinely emit
action items with ``assignee = {"email": null, "name": null, "team":
null}`` when Fathom cannot attribute the action to a calendar invitee —
ad-hoc tasks the AI surfaces without an explicit owner.

These tests pin the null-assignee shape so a future "tighten the model"
change can't silently reintroduce the ValidationError that blocked live
recordings.
