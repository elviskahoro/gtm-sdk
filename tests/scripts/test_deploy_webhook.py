"""Smoke tests for scripts/webhooks-redeploy.py.

Verifies the substitute -> deploy -> restore loop preserves the working tree,
even when the deploy fails mid-iteration. Stubs modal / infisical / uv / gcloud
so the test never makes real network calls.

Sets ``DAGGER_DRY_RUN=1`` so the script's deploy step shells out to the host
stubs instead of spinning up a Dagger engine. The non-dry-run path (which
runs ``modal deploy`` inside a Dagger container) is covered by manual smoke
tests — running it in CI would require a Dagger engine and real Modal/GCP
credentials.

BD: gtm-sdk-43z (epic gtm-sdk-yol). Each test maps to one acceptance criterion.
