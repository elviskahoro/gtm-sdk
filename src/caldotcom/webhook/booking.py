"""Webhook ETL contract for Cal.com booking ingestion.

Cal.com ships 7 trigger types across 4 payload shapes. The
``libs.caldotcom.models`` discriminated union parses each into a typed payload
variant; this module dispatches on the variant and emits the right Attio op.

Attio constraints (probed 2026-05-25 — see plan-02): ``/v2/meetings/`` is
append-only. Meeting state changes (cancel / reschedule / no-show / rating)
have nowhere to land on the Meeting record itself.

Per the spec at
``design/backlog-202605251625-meeting_state_attrs_on_tracking_events-spec-01.md``
each webhook produces:

1. ``UpsertCompany`` for the host's email domain.
2. ``UpsertPerson`` for the host (matching by email; the libs adapter links
   to the company auto-created in step 1).
3. ``UpsertMeeting`` (only on ``BOOKING_CREATED`` — the Meeting record itself
   is still created once and never mutated).
4. ``EmitMeetingLifecycleEvent`` — ONE per meeting (NOT per attendee). The
   dispatcher's ``LookupTable`` resolves the ``host`` PersonRef from step 2,
   and a single ``tracking_events`` row per meeting is PATCHed in place as
   the meeting transitions through states (scheduled → cancelled, etc.). The
   row's ``details`` field accrues a one-line history of every transition;
   the ``body`` field always holds the latest raw webhook payload.

This is a deliberate departure from plan-02, which wrote one row per
(meeting × attendee) linked to each attendee. The new per-meeting model uses
fewer rows, makes status filterable as a typed field, and is what the user
wants the Attio UI to surface. Attendee identity is preserved in
``body`` (raw payload) and ``details`` (e.g. "attendees: alice, bob").
