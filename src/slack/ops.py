"""Source-agnostic Slack message operations.

A source webhook's ``slack_get_messages()`` returns ``list[SlackMessage]``;
``src.slack.export.execute`` turns each into a ``chat.postMessage`` call,
applying threading + urgent-broadcast policy. Mirrors the ``src.attio.ops`` /
``src.attio.export`` split so adding a new source requires no change to the
dispatcher.

class SlackMessage:
    """One Slack post in a per-booking thread.

    - ``thread_key`` groups every lifecycle event for one booking into a single
      Slack thread. The first message for a key starts the thread (a top-level
      channel post); later messages for the same key reply inside it.
    - ``text`` is the fallback/notification string (required by Slack even when
      ``blocks`` render).
    - ``blocks`` is the Block Kit payload.
    - ``urgent`` broadcasts a threaded reply back into the channel so it isn't
      missed (cancellations, no-shows). Ignored for the thread-opening message,
      which is already a channel post.
    - ``event_subtype`` is carried for logging/observability only.
    - ``mention_email`` is the email of the person to @-mention (the host). The
      dispatcher resolves it to a Slack user id via ``users.lookupByEmail`` at
      post time (the builder has no Slack client) and pings them in-message;
      unresolvable emails (non-member / missing ``users:read.email`` scope)
      degrade silently to no mention.
