"""Source-agnostic Slack message dispatcher.

Source webhooks return ``list[SlackMessage]`` from ``slack_get_messages()``;
this module posts each to Slack, threading every message that shares a
``thread_key`` under the first one and broadcasting urgent replies back to the
channel. Imports only ``libs.slack.*`` and ``src.slack.*`` — adding a new
source webhook should require no change here.

    """Post ``messages`` to ``channel``, threading by ``thread_key``.

    First message for a ``thread_key`` opens the thread (top-level post) and its
    ``ts`` is recorded in ``thread_store``. Subsequent messages for the same key
    reply in-thread; ``urgent`` replies also broadcast to the channel. When a
    later event arrives but no thread anchor exists (e.g. the opening event was
    never delivered), it falls back to a top-level post so the event is never
    silently dropped.

    Threading is best-effort, not guaranteed, and not idempotent:

    - Non-atomic race: the anchor lookup is a read-modify-write
      (``get`` -> post -> ``set``) and the Modal endpoint runs
      ``@modal.concurrent``. Two events for the same booking arriving close
      together can both see no anchor and each open a separate top-level
      thread. A put-if-absent on the store would be needed to elect a single
      opener deterministically.
    - Redelivery duplicates: there is no idempotency key on the message. A
      Hookdeck **redelivery** of the opening event re-posts it — as a threaded
      reply (the anchor now exists) duplicating the original; a redelivery of a
      later event re-posts that reply. Keying the store on
      ``(thread_key, event_subtype)`` or recording posted event ids would
      suppress this.

    Both are accepted edges for a best-effort notifier (lifecycle events for one
    booking are rarely simultaneous and Hookdeck redelivery is infrequent).
