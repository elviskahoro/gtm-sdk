"""Source-agnostic Attio operation dispatcher.

Source webhooks return ``list[AttioOp]`` via their ``attio_get_operations``

only from ``libs.attio.*`` and ``src.attio.ops`` — adding a new source webhook

    Resolution runs in two phases around the write because ``/v2/meetings``
    auto-creates a Person for each ``participant`` — a record that does not yet
    exist when we first resolve, so a single pre-write pass would permanently
    drop every first-time attendee (the gap roborev flagged).

    Phase 1 links the records that already exist (``attempts=1`` — no read-after-
    write race for pre-existing records) and POSTs the meeting, which creates the
    participant Persons. Phase 2 re-resolves the refs that missed with
    ``attempts=3`` and a repeat POST re-syncs the newly found records onto the
    meeting. ``/v2/meetings`` is a sync endpoint — repeat POSTs sharing an
    ``ical_uid`` converge the same record's ``linked_records`` — so the second
    write attaches them rather than duplicating the meeting. The retry serves a
    participant Person (just auto-created — guaranteed to resolve) and a Company
    alike (a transient lookup miss, or one created by a concurrent pipeline).

    Companies are still link-if-exists, never create: Attio does not create them
    from participants the way it does Persons, and manufacturing a company per
    raw email domain (e.g. ``gmail.com``) would pollute the CRM. A domain that is
    genuinely not in Attio stays unresolved after the retry and is surfaced in
    the ``unresolved_meeting_links`` warning rather than linked or invented.

    Person identities other than ``email`` (linkedin/github_handle) resolve only
    via the plan's LookupTable — the live lookup is email-only — so an unresolved
    one is dropped immediately (not retriable) and likewise surfaced.

    Match-first (ai-4bz): when ``op.match_existing_by_participants`` is set (the
    Fathom path, which has no calendar ``ical_uid``), first try to resolve an
    existing Attio meeting by participants + start window. On a confident match
    we return that meeting's record_id WITHOUT writing — the calendar-synced
    meeting already owns its participants, and ``find_or_create`` would not merge
    our links onto a pre-existing row anyway (it returns it frozen). The
    record_id still lands in the plan's LookupTable (keyed by the op's
    ``ical_uid``), so a downstream ``UpsertNote.meeting`` attaches the recording
    to the right meeting. No match → fall through and create as normal.
