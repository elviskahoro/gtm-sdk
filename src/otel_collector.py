"""Telemetry collector: an OpenTelemetry Collector running on Modal that fans
out to all providers, reached purely over Modal RPC (no public endpoint).

Architecture (see ``libs/telemetry.py`` for the app side):

    app/webhook/CLI ──.spawn(signal, otlp_bytes)──▶  fan_out (Modal function)
      (custom OTEL exporter serializes each batch)        │  POST localhost:4318/v1/{signal}
                                                          ▼
                                                   otelcol (localhost sidecar in this
                                                   same always-warm container)
                                                     batch + retry_on_failure + sending_queue
                                                          ├─▶ Dash0     (Dash0-Dataset header)
                                                          ├─▶ HyperDX
                                                          └─▶ Logfire

Why this shape: apps reach the collector through Modal's authenticated RPC
(``.spawn``), so there is **no inbound web URL** — the otelcol OTLP receiver is
bound to ``127.0.0.1`` and is unreachable from outside the container. Yet the
heavy lifting (batching, retry, queueing, fan-out to N providers) is done by a
real OpenTelemetry Collector rather than hand-rolled Python.

``min_containers=1`` + ``max_containers=1`` pin this to exactly one
always-warm container, so the otelcol process and its in-memory queue are a
single shared buffer (rather than Modal scaling out N containers, each with its
own isolated queue). The queue is in-memory (not Volume-backed): a container
recycle can lose an unflushed batch, which is fine for non-load-bearing
telemetry.

This is a **standalone** Modal app (its own ``modal.App``), NOT registered in
``src/app.py``'s ``_ENDPOINT_MODULES``. Deploy it on its own:

    infisical run --projectId "$INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID" --token "$INFISICAL_TOKEN" \\
        --env=dev -- uv run modal deploy src/otel_collector.py
