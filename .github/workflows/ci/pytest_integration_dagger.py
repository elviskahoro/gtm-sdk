"""Dagger pipeline: run integration pytest in a container and export the JUnit report.

Invoked the same way locally and in CI:

    dagger run python .github/workflows/ci/pytest_integration_dagger.py

The pipeline runs the integration test marker inside a python:3.13 container, then
exports `junit.xml` to the host so a follow-up step (e.g. trunk-io/analytics-uploader)
can upload it.

The pipeline *fails* (non-zero exit) when pytest exits non-zero — a real test
failure OR the collection-time preflight in tests/integration/conftest.py
(missing required Attio object) — while still exporting the report. This is the
whole point of ai-eun: a previous `... || true` swallowed pytest's exit code, so
the job went green even when zero tests ran. We instead capture pytest's exit
code into `/src/pytest_rc` (the trailing `echo` keeps the `with_exec` itself
green so the report stays exportable) and re-raise it after the export.

The integration suite reads its credentials straight from the process environment
(see `INTEGRATION_SECRET_ENV_VARS`); there is no in-container Infisical CLI bootstrap.
Each required value must be present in the host environment — in CI from individual
`secrets.*` GitHub Actions secrets (synced into the repo by Infisical's GitHub App
integration), locally from `infisical run -- …`. They are forwarded into the container
as Dagger secrets, never baked into an image layer.
