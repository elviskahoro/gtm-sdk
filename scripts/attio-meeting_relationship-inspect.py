"""Verify the Attio meeting↔person/company link does not strip prior links.

This gates the Fathom→Attio meeting backfill (ai-crf). Per the
`attio-inverse-relationship-multiselect` knowledge: Attio enforces inverse-link
uniqueness based on the *other* side's `is_multiselect`. If the inverse
attribute on `people`/`companies` (the record-reference pointing back at
`meetings`) is single-valued, then each person/company can be linked to at most
ONE meeting at a time — linking a person to a new meeting would synchronously
strip them off the meeting they were previously linked to. Running the
204-recording backfill against a single-valued inverse would silently corrupt
links as it walks the recordings.

The meetings feature is ALPHA and provisioned only in PROD (dev POST /v2/meetings
404s), so this is verifiable only against the prod `dltHub` workspace.

Two modes:

  * Config inspection (default, READ-ONLY): reads `is_multiselect` on the
    people/companies record-reference attributes that point at meetings, and
    dumps the `relationship` object on the meeting linking attribute when the
    alpha schema exposes it. Emits a config verdict. Because the alpha meetings
    schema may not expose these attributes via the objects/attributes API, a
    missing inverse attribute is reported as INCONCLUSIVE (not a hard STOP) —
    the empirical mode below is the authoritative gate.

  * Empirical (`--idempotency-check --execute`, WRITES TO PROD): creates
    clearly-labeled throwaway meetings and proves two things directly:
      1. Idempotency — re-POSTing one meeting with the same ical_uid + links
         converges to the same meeting with `linked_records` identical
         (set-union, no duplicate append, no second meeting created).
      2. No contention — linking the SAME person AND company to a second
         meeting does NOT strip either off the first meeting (the real
         backfill-gating concern), exercising both independent inverses.
    The organizer/participant email is kept distinct from the probed person so
    participant auto-linking cannot mask a single-valued linked_records inverse,
    and a preflight refuses to run unless the probed records have zero existing
    meeting links (so the probe can never strip a real link). /v2/meetings has
    no DELETE, so these test meetings are permanent; they are named
    `ai-3hq-verify-*` and join the handful of existing test meetings.

The Infisical environment is explicit (no silent prod default): pass `--env` or
set `INFISICAL_ENV`. The script self-bootstraps `infisical run` from
`gtm-sdk/.env.local` when `ATTIO_API_KEY` is not already injected.

Usage:

    scripts/attio-meeting_relationship-inspect.py --env prod
    scripts/attio-meeting_relationship-inspect.py --env prod \
        --idempotency-check --execute
